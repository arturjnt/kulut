## About

This project was mainly build to work as an android apk, but flutter being flutter, it's easily converted to web and mobile.

## WIP

There are known bugs and major improvements to be done:

### Known Bugs
1. Editing not showing real value if it's a combined expense & combined expenses checkbox is unticked
2. When editing is saved, the expense owner is changing (it should stay the original one)

### Missing Work
1. Comments
2. Tests


### Suggested improvements
1. Travel category
2. Split with more than one people
3. Add categories dynamically
