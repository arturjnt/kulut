# Kulut - Expense Tracker

Having used many money tracking apps, and split payment apps over the years, I've never found one that suited my needs and did both. So here we are.

Check my [website](https://artur-teixeira.tech/) if you're interested in working together.

## About

This project was mainly build to work as an android apk, but flutter being flutter, it's easily converted to web and mobile.

This is a **WIP**, there are known bugs and major improvements to be done, please check [the project](https://github.com/arturjnt/kulut/projects/1), here on GitHub, to see how you can help.

## Build instructions
Generate a file `google-services.json` on firebase and add it to the `/android/app/` folder. It should be similar to the `/android/app/google-services.json.example` file already there.

Then run `flutter run` to compile to debug mode.
